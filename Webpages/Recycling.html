<b>
Situation:</b><br>
One of the most recent trends in environmental solution is recycling project. All famous IB schools would have a recycling project backing up their promise in environmental solutions. However, our current recycling project isn't solid. This would create a question to the future potential member of our community such as "If SWA can't even accomplish a small problem, how could SWA accomplish a larger problem such as achieving SWA's own vision?" This would create a bad impression of our community that it will reduce the chance of future potential member of our community to ever join our community.
 <br>
<br>
<b>
Proposed Solution:</b><br> Through this project, we are trying to reduce our large carbon footprint as a direct result of the use of the wide range facilities offered by SWA. At the same time, this project would lead SWA another step closer to its vision. Another goal of this project it to build a place where everyone in the community can be a part of, which in this case is an organic garden. Through the realization of the project, we are providing a very small solution that can engage, act, thrive and create a big impact in the future in the everlasting debate of the Global Warming.
  <br>
<br>
<b>
Steps Involved:</b>
<ul>
<li>Design and plan teaching session for the cleaners</li>
<li>Have teaching session with the cleaners of the step by steps of the Recycling Project.</li>
<li>Have teaching session with the whole SWA community.</li>
<li> Sustain the project with the help of the the whole of the SWA community.</li>
<li>Plan for future development of the project.</li>
 </ul>
  <br>

<b>
<span style="padding-left:25px">Benefits:</span></b>
<ul>
<li>The existence of the recycling project will reduce the amount of trash that would end up in the landfill</li>
<li>The presence of the project may raise future more ambitious projects.</li>
<li>The presence of the project would unite SWA community (can only happen in we embrace everyone in SWA community to be a part of the project).</li>
<li>Lead SWA another step closer to SWA's vision. This would create a selling point for SWA compared to competitors.</li>
</ul>
